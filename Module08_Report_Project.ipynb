        "2. What is the type of machine learning?\n",

        "3. What are the feature variables and target variables?\n",
        " The feature variables include attributes like age, gender, passenger class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, etc. The target variable is \"Survived,\" which indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).\n",

        "7. What is the conclusion? Is it reasonable?\n",
